Create a web-based digital attendance system for a school with the following requirements:

1. **Role-based Access:**
   - Admin panel for school administration to monitor teacher attendance.
   - Data entry panel for two designated staff members to enter teacher attendance daily.
   - Use pre-set login details without authentication mechanisms (e.g., hardcoded usernames and passwords stored locally).
     - Admin Login: Username: "admin", Password: "admin123"
     - Data Entry Login: Username: "dataentry", Password: "data123"

2. **Attendance Input Features:**
   - Simple, user-friendly UI for quickly marking attendance for 60 teachers.
   - Option to input attendance in bulk or one-by-one.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) to analyze attendance trends over time.
   - Filters for specific teachers, time ranges, and attendance types (e.g., full-day, half-day).
   - Individual teacher analysis to view attendance patterns for a single teacher.

4. **Notifications and Alerts:**
   - Alert admin for irregular attendance patterns or prolonged absences.

5. **UI/UX Standards:**
   - Intuitive, clean, and responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile.
   - Clear navigation for different user roles and tasks.

6. **Database Requirements:**
   - Use a local SQLite database to store attendance data, teacher records, and login details.
   - Include predefined schema and sample data for login credentials and teacher records.

7. **Tech Stack:**
   - Use React.js for the front end.
   - Backend can be Node.js or Python Flask for SQLite database integration.

8. **Additional Features:**
   - Export attendance data as CSV or PDF.
   - Ensure easy-to-understand code for maintainability.

Generate the complete codebase for this system, including:
- A fully styled frontend.
- Backend APIs for handling attendance, role-based access, and individual teacher analysis.
- SQLite database setup with predefined schema and sample data.
